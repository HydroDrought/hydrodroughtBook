## Instructions for use

### Option 1: Static version in HTML (website) 

 * Worked Example 5.1: [Flow Duration Curve](https://combinatronics.com/jstagge/hydroDrought/master/worked_examples/5-1_flow_duration_curve.html)


### Option 2: Run code live in the cloud with no prerequisites

Click at this badge to execute the analysis and replicate results using R-Studio in the cloud without needing to install R or its dependencies on your local machine.    
RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jstagge/hydroDrought/tree/master/worked_examples/?urlpath=rstudio)

If you want to share this live RStudio link with others, please share this URL: http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jstagge/hydroDrought/tree/master/worked_examples/?urlpath=rstudio

*Note*, URLs that contain (https://hub.mybinder.org.....) will become invalid after few minutes of inactivity.

Once RStudio launches online, it will come with all the prerequisites installed and ready to execute. So skip ```Rscript 00_prepare_file_system.R``` step in running the code.    
 

### Option 3: Run code on a local machine   
These instructions will allow you to process the reproducibility survey data on your local machine for testing purposes. All code is written in R. See Prerequisites and Running sections below for detailed instructions.  

### Prerequisites

In order to run this code, you must install:
* [R for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/)

All necesary R packages will be installed automatically in the first file.

## Running the Code

First, make sure to set the working directory to the downloaded and unzipped folder.  

### Running all scripts at once

Code is numbered based on the order of operations. For more detailed information about each file, see below:
