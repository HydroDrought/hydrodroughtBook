### This is all of our standard setup
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw(base_size = 10))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

## Set the Paths
###########################################################################
### Set here path as the current location of your code
require(here)
here_path <- here::here()

### Path for Data and Output	
data_path <- file.path(here_path, "data")
output_path <- file.path(here_path, "output")

### Set up output folder for this specific example
### We will use this to save our results
write_output_path <- file.path(output_path, "01-introduction")
dir.create(write_output_path, recursive=TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

```
