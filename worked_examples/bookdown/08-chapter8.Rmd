## Worked example 8.1: Regional regression

### Introduction
This vignette demonstrates the application of regional regression analysis to model low flows in a spatial context. We use the regional dataset of 30 catchments situated in the forelands and pre-Alps in the north-east of Austria (Section 4.5.2). The dataset is fully described in Laaha & Bl√∂schl (2006a, 2006b). The target variable is the long-term low flow characteristic $q_{95}$, i.e. $Q_{95}$ standardized by catchment area to eliminate its predominant effect on low flows. For nested catchments, the $q_{95}$ was disaggregated into the residual $q_{95}$ of sub-catchments to decrease statistical dependency of observations. The method assumes synchronicity of low flow events of neighboring gauges at the same river. For more details on this particular river network approach see Section 8.7.2.

In this section we learn how to

* fit a multiple linear regression model, 
* perform stepwise regression to perform variable selection and deal with collinearity, 
* employ the Cook's distance method to deal with outliers, 
* use the MM-type robust regression method, and 
* create specific plots to analyse the quality of the regression model and the specific contribution of each predictor to the regression estimate.


### Data import
The text file named `Austria_30.txt` contains several catchment characteristics for the 30 catchments of the regional data set. Each observation (each line) in the text file corresponds to a single gauging station located at the catchment outlet. The variables (our catchment descriptors) are represented as columns of this data set. 

Let us import this tabular data set into an object `x0`. As the very first line of the  text file contains the column headers, we have to specify the `header` argument accordingly. The function `read.table()` will return a `data.frame`. 

```{r}
x0 <- read.table("../../data/Austria_30.txt", header = TRUE)
```


To get a glimpse of the imported data set, let us print the first three lines of the object `x0`. They contain the catchment descriptors of the first three catchments. 

```{r}
head(x0, n = 3)
```

To make sure all variables are imported either as class `integer` or `numeric` (and not accidentally as class `character` or `factor`) let us have a look at the structure of the object `x0`. Calling the function `str()` will print the dimensions of the `data.frame` in the very first line. The following lines contain the name of each variable, its class, and the first few values. 

```{r}
str(x0)
```

Another way to find out the dimensions of an object is to call `dim(x0)`, `ncol(x0)` or `nrow(x0)` explicitly. 

The raw data set `x0` contains some variables which we do not want to use in our regression model, e.g. the id number or the coordinates of the gauging station. We will remove the columns to simplify the subsequent analysis. It is also a good idea to assign meaningful row names to the `data.frame` (e.g. the station's id `'HZBNR'` or its location name ) to be able to identify the observations later on. 


```{r}
rownames(x0) <- x0$HZBNR

remove <- c("DBMSNR", "HZBNR", "X_LB", "Y_LB", "q95s", "q95w", "A")
keep <- setdiff(colnames(x0), remove)
x <- x0[, keep]
head(x)
```


### Simple linear regression
As a starting point of the analysis, we fit a simple linear regression model. We take the mean annual precipitation $P$ as the predictor, since it is likely an important control of low flows in the study area.
```{r, fig.height=6}
lm.simple <- lm(q95 ~ P, data = x)

summary(lm.simple)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lm.simple)
```


<!-- Explore the fitted model object -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- str(lm.simple) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Note that the object is a list, containing vectors, data frames, etc. as elements.  -->
<!-- These elements may be extracted for further analysis via, e.g.`lm.simple$residuals` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- lm.simple$residuals -->
<!-- ``` -->

The regression summary contains the residual statistics, the coefficients table, and performance statistics such as the residual standard error (equivalent to the $RMSE$) and the multiple R-squared (equivalent to the coefficient of determination $R^2$). We see from the t-test that $P$ is a highly significant predictor ($p-value$ =`0.00482`) but the intercept is not significant at the $\alpha$ =`0.05` level. We further learn that the model explains `25.08 %` of the low flow variability in the study area, which is quite high for a single predictor model. The estimated regression coefficient of $P$ (when multiplied by 100) translates to a $q_{95}$ increase of `0.53` $l s^{-1} km^{-2}$ per 100 mm increase in precipitation index.

The residual plots can be used to verify the assumptions of the model. In our example, the residuals are quite normally distributed but extreme outliers seem to violate this assumption. A procedure how to deal with such outliers is discussed later in the worked example. The diagnosis gives no clear evidence about the homoscedasticity, due to the presence of outliers in combination with a small data set.

### Stepwise regression

In stepwise regression an 'optimal' model (based on some information criterion, such as the $AIC$, $BIC$ or $C_p$) is obtained by iteratively adding and removing variables. Our procedure will be based on the $AIC$, following the standard setting in $R$. The elementary steps of adding and dropping variables are demonstrated below.  


#### Manual forward selection
The first approach to stepwise regression is to start from the empty model and adding the variable with highest explicative value. Such a *manual forward selection* can be performed by calling `add1()`. The function takes a fitted model object together with a `scope` formula which specifies the variables to be considered for adding. In our case the scope contains all variables. Instead of using an empty model our initial model already contains the mean annual precipitation $P$, as we can savely assume that the $q_{95}$ low flow will depend on the long-term average precipitation of the catchment. 

```{r}
model.init <- lm(q95 ~ P, data = x)
scope <- formula(paste("~", paste(colnames(x)[-1], collapse = " + ")))
add1(model.init, scope = scope)
```


```{r include=FALSE, results=FALSE}
tab <- add1(model.init, scope = scope)
best <- head(tab[order(tab$AIC), ], 1)
```

This table tells us that the model would profit most from adding the variable $`r rownames(best)`$ , as this would would minimize the $AIC$ to a value of ``r round(best$AIC, 2)`` and the sum of squared residuals $RSS$ to a value of ``r round(best$RSS, 1)``.  The resulting model is considered better if its $AIC$ is lower than the one of the original model whose performance can be read from the first line of the table, with the label ``r rownames(tab[1,])``.


#### Manual backward selection
When starting from a complex model with several predictors the function `drop1()` can be used to remove the least significant variable. The resulting model is again considered better if its $AIC$ is lower than the one of the original model. This procedure is called *backward selection*. 

Care shall be taken when fitting a full model that contains all catchment characteristics, as some of them are usually correlated, leading to a problem known as multicollinearity. Multicollinearity harms parameter estimation and leads to overfitted models, whose parameters are ill-deterimined and have little physical significance. In our case, minimum, maximum and range of altitude are exactly collinear, which means that one of the three variables can be dropped without any loss of information. Other variables respresenting precipitation, geology, altitude, and other landscape characteristics are likely to be collinear as well. As a consequence, we should not fit a model to the full set of catchment characteristics available for the study area. 

Likewise, the backward selection needs to start with a well-defined model. Let us therfore assume that we whant to test a model consiting of  the five variables $P$, $Hm$, $Sm$, $Gq$, $Lf$, which represent different types of catchment characteristics. 

```{r}
model.full <- lm(q95 ~ P + Hm + Sm + Gq + Lf, data = x)
```

```{r}
drop1(model.full)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
tab <- drop1(model.full)
#best <- head(tab[order(tab$AIC, decreasing = TRUE), ], 1)
worst <- head(tab[order(tab$AIC, decreasing = FALSE), ], 1)
```

The above table tells us that among all single term deletions the model without $`r rownames(worst)`$ would have the the lowest $AIC$ = ``r round(worst$AIC, 2)`` and the lowest sum of squared residuals RSS = ``r round(worst$RSS, 1)`` . This means that dropping $`r rownames(worst)`$ would significantly improve the model.


#### Automated variable selection
Single variable addition and deletion can be used repeatedly unless any removal or addition of a variable would result in an increase of the $AIC$ and therefore in an inferior model. Such an automated variable selection is performed by the fuction `step`. Its argument `direction` specifies the mode of stepwise search: `foreward`, `backward` and `both` directions (default).  

```{r, fig.height=6}
lm.both <- step(model.init, scope = scope, direction = "both", trace = 0) 
summary(lm.both)
```

The resulting model consists of four predictors $Lwa, Ggs, Sm, Gc$ and exhibits a coefficient of determination of $R^2 = 0.69$, which is a major improvement over the  simple linear regression model based on $P$. 


#### Plotting the results

One can show the model performance in a scatter plot by printing the predicted values of $q_{95}$ against the actual, observed values. 

```{r}
par(pty="s")
plot(x = x$q95, y = fitted(lm.both), xlab = "observed q95", ylab = "predicted q95")
abline(lsfit(lm.both$model$q95, lm.both$fitted.values))
```


To depict the contribution of each predictor $x_j$ to the estimated $q95$ the function `termplot()` plots each regression term ($\beta_j \cdot x_j$) against its predictor. All four predictor variables exhibit a positive influence on low flows, but the quality of the relationship differs greatly. For $L_{wa}$ the value of the predictor is `0` for most cases, so the term only affects very few catchments that have a water surface area greater than zero. At the other end of the spectrum is $S_m$ which exhibits a positive linear effect for the entire data set. The predictors $G_c$ and $G_s$ exhibit a linear effect for the majority of catchments and are thus in between these cases.


```{r, fig.height=6}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
termplot(lm.both, partial.resid = TRUE) 
```

As a final step, the assumptions of the model need to be checked by diagnostic plots. 


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(lm.both)
```


### Remove outliers based on Cook's distance

```{r include=FALSE}
cooks <- sort(abs(cooks.distance(lm.both)), decreasing = TRUE)
```


In the diagnostic plot of the final model obtained by stepwise regression the station with id number ``r names(cooks)[1]`` popped out because of its high Cook's distance of ``r round(cooks[1], 2)``. Such points can can act as leverage points and force the model to get close to them. The model is then too much representing single observations rather than providing an ovarall representation of the data set. In the Cook's distance method the levereage points are held out from model fitting to perform robust parameter estimation.       
 
The analysis is conducted in 3 steps (that may be repeated until no outliers remain...)

(@) Detect outliers based on Cook's distance. You can do this either by looking a the diagnostic plot or by subsetting the result of the function `cooks.distance()`. Let's for example eliminate all outliers with an absolute Cook's distance larger than 1.
```{r}
pos <- which(abs(cooks.distance(lm.both)) >= 1)
pos
```
 
In our data set this is the station with the id number ``r names(pos)``, which is observation number (row number) ``r pos``.
 

(@) Now we can eliminate the outliers manually, by removing this row. 
```{r}
x1 <- x[-pos, ]
dim(x1)
```

(@) Finally we have to re-run our stepwise regression model. 

```{r}
lm.new <- step(lm(q95 ~ P, data = x1), scope = scope, trace = 0) 
summary(lm.new)

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(lm.new)
```


The so obtained model is free of leverage points and consists of a slightly different parameter set. The coefficient of determination is somewhat higher than the privious stepwise regression model, but needs to be interpreted with care as it is not evaluated for the entire data set.

### Robust regression (alternative to manual outlier detection)

Robust regression can be used as an alternative to manual outlier detection. A number of methods exist. Some of the methods, however, tend to be more sensitive to outliers than to leverage points, and will therefore be less suited than the Cook‚Äôs distance method. We use here an MM-type estimator, which constitutes the current standard in $R$'s `robustbase` package. The estimator performs a maximum-likelihood type estimation that is highly efficient and robust to leverage points as well. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(robustbase)
model <- q95 ~ Ggs + Gc + Sm + H0
x.rob <- lmrob(formula = model, data = x)
summary(x.rob)
plot(x.rob)
```

We can see that the robust MM-estimator leads to a well-fitted model with a low $RMSE$ and a high $R^2$. Note, however, that the fit statistics of the robust regression method are not fully comparable with those of the standard regression method as outliers are downweigted in the parameter estimation and will receive lower weight in the fit statistics as well. The residual plots allow a direct comparison among different models. Compared to standard OLS-regression, the MM-estimator performs much better for the majority of cases while showing poor fit for extreme outliers. Leverage points appear to have little impact on the model.

## Worked example 8.2: Top-kriging

```{r, include=FALSE}
# str() doesn't respect the options(width = ...)
str <- function(...) utils::str(..., width = 75, strict.width = "cut")

options("rgdal_show_exportToProj4_warnings"="none")
```

### Introduction
This vignette demonstrates the application of Top-kriging presented in Sk√∏ien et al. (2006, 2014) to model low flows along the stream network. We use a dataset of 30 gauged and 373 ungauged catchments situated in the forelands and pre-Alps in the north-east of Austria, for details see Section 4.5.2. The target variable is the long-term low flow characteristic $q_{95}$, i.e. $Q_{95}$ standardized by catchment area. The data consist of overlapping catchment polygons provided in two Shapefiles, the first containing the observed catchments only, the second containing all catchments (prediction locations incl. observed catchments). 

In this worked example, we learn 

* how to import SpatialPolygonDataFrames and store them as an rtopObj, 
* perform explorative statistics and conduct variogram analysis, 
* fit a variogram model and employ kriging to perform prediction to catchments along the stream network
* perform cross-validation, 
* and create low flow maps of observed and predicted values.
 

### Data import

We will use the `rtop` package to perform kriging along the river network and the package `rgdal` for handling geospatial data. 
We load the packages (after installation at first use).

```{r}
library(rtop)
library(rgdal)
```

#### Reading Shapefiles

The methods used here take the catchment topology into account. Our data are therefore Shapefiles that contain the (overlapping) catchment polygons together with an attribute table containing the low flow index and other catchment information. The data is provided in two files. The first file named ¬¥File1.shp¬¥ contains the 30 observed catchments and is used for model fitting. The second one named ¬¥File2.shp¬¥ contains the whole data set (prediction locations incl. observed catchments) and is used for the prediction. 

For the import, we first set the path of the data directory where the Shapefiles are stored:
```{r}
rpath <- "../../data/catchment_shape_files"
```

We can now read the Shapefile containing the observation dataset.
```{r}
x.obs <- readOGR(rpath,"File1")
```
<!-- x.obs <- readOGR(rpath,"Watershed_Gesamt_zone1_nwkenn_OBS") # Former name of observation data set -->


We then create a new column `x.obs$obs` that shall contain the observed values of our target variable. Note that top-kriging requires the flow characteristic standardized per unit area (specific discharge in $l s^{-1} km^{-2}$), which may need to be calculated from absolute discharge values. In our case, the observed values of specific low flow `x.obs$Q95S` are simply assigned to the newly created column `x.obs$obs`.

```{r}
x.obs$obs <- x.obs$Q95S
```

The imported object belongs to the `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`-class, which consists of 5 slots. We can access each slot (using "@"). This allows us to check the data structure of the attribute table:

```{r}
slotNames(x.obs)
str(x.obs@data)
```

The import and preparation of the prediction dataset is done analogously.

```{r}
x.pred = readOGR(rpath,"File2")
x.pred$obs <- x.pred$Q95S # also in x.pred for ploting
```
<!-- x.pred = readOGR(rpath,"Watershed_Gesamt_zone1_nwkenn_PRED_BIG3") # Former name of prediction data set -->

#### Creating an rtopObj

The easiest way to use the functionality of the *rtop*-package is to create a particular *rtop*-object. In this step, we need to specify the `observations` and the `predictionLocations` object and use the `formulaString` argument to define the dependent variable and the kriging method. We use `obs~1` to perform ordinary Top-kriging of a dependent variable `obs`. For large data sets this step may be time consuming so it is recommended to set the option `gdist=TRUE` to calculate a simplified distance measure that will reduce computation time.

```{r}
params <- list(gDist = TRUE)
rtopObj <- createRtopObject(observations=x.obs, predictionLocations=x.pred, formulaString = obs~1, params = params)
names(rtopObj)
```

For most functions, the parameters can either be set directly during the function call, or specified in a `params` list and set  as default using the `params` argument.

### Explorative statistics

#### Checking the low flow distribution

Before starting the geostatistical analysis we need to verify the basic assumption of kriging that data shall follow a Gaussian distribution to achieve best linear unbiased estimates. We see from the histograms that the raw data exhibit a skewed distribution so we test different variable transformations.

```{r}
hist(rtopObj$observations$obs)
hist(log(rtopObj$observations$obs))
hist(sqrt(rtopObj$observations$obs), breaks=9)
```

We can see that the sqrt-transformation performs somewhat better than the log-transformation to approximate a Gaussian distribution. Alternatively, the Box-Cox transformation (Section 7.X) can be used to fine-tune the transformation parameters to better approximate normality. 

#### Data transformation

The best-performing transformation is then applied to the `obs` data slots, to transform the `observations` and `predictionLocations`in the `rtopObj`.

```{r}
rtopObj$observations$obs <- sqrt(x.obs$Q95S)
rtopObj$predictionLocations$obs <- sqrt(x.pred$Q95S)
```

We finally review the observations in the `rtobObj` to ensure that our transformation was successful.

```{r}
hist(rtopObj$observations$obs, nclass=9)
```

#### Summary statistics

We compute summary statistics to provide insight into the distribution of the (transformed) low flow data.

```{r}
summary(rtopObj$observations$obs)
```

#### Ploting the data

In a final explorative assessment, the values are presented in a geographic map to provide a first impression about the spatial distribution of low flows in the study area. In the left panel we show the untransformed specific low flows, in the right panel the transformed values. We can observe a spatial pattern of decreasing low flows from west to east. The highest values can be found in the south-west in a low-mountain range of about 1000 m altitude.

```{r}
spplot(obj=rtopObj$observations, col.regions = rev(heat.colors(n=100)), col="grey",
       c("Q95S", "obs"))
```


### Variogram analysis

As in classical geostatistics, the variogram analysis proceeds in two steps. We first calculate the sample variogram representing the spatial correlation structure of observed low flow characteristics. We then fit a theoretical variogram model to the sample variogram, which is used to estimate the optimal weights for the kriging estimator.


#### Sample variogram

A call to `rtopVariogram` adds the sample variogram to the `rtopObj`. The package supports both binned variograms and variogram clouds.

```{r}
rtopObj <- rtopVariogram(rtopObj, cloud=TRUE)
```

#### Theoretical variogram (various support)

As opposed to ordinary kriging, the theoretical point variogram of Top-kriging cannot be fitted directly to the sample data, due to the different support of the observations. Instead, the function `fitVariogram` optimizes a point variogram model whose regularized semivariogram values yield best fit to the sample variogram values. This is performed in a iterative procedure, known as *back-calculation*.

```{r}
rtopObj <- rtopFitVariogram(rtopObj)
```

The function checkVario generates some diagnostic plots that are usful in variogram analysis. The first two explore the data before variogram fitting, whereas the last two show the correspondence between the sample variogram and the fitted variogram.

```{r}
checkVario(rtopObj, cloud=TRUE, identify=TRUE, acor=0.000001, legx=39000)
```

We can see from the first plot the relationship between the variance of observations (known as dispersion variance) and catchment area, with the size of circles proportional to the number of observations in each area class. One of the assumptions of Top-kriging is that the dispersion variance decreases with increasing area, what should be visible from the figure. In our case the evidence is quite uncertain due to limited data in most area classes.

The second plot shows the variogram cloud where each point represents a pair of catchments. The cloud is useful for identifying outliers that should be discarded from variogram analysis to foster robust parameter estimation. Our plot shows a typical decrease of dissimilarity at larger distances. There is no evidence for outliers (such as strata of high semivariances for data pairs attributed to an extreme observation).

The third plot shows a (log‚Äìlog scaled) scatter plot of theoretical (regularized) semivariogram values from a fitted variogram model vs. the sample variogram values. The size of the circles is relative to the number of pairs in each bin. A cloud close to the 1:1 line indicates a good model fit. In our case the model (regularized gamma) deviates from the sample for small semivariances values, while showing a fairly good fit for the remaining range of the variogram.

The fourth plot shows the (tree-dimensional) variogram model of Top-kriging, i.e. semivariance as a function of distance and area. Lines represent the theoretical variogram model, with solid lines representing regularized semivariograms of equally sized catchments and dotted lines representing combinations of catchments sizes. Points represent the sample variogram, with point size relative to the number of pairs in each bin. The plot shows a linear point-variogram and the decrease of semivariances with catchment area, as a consequence of regularization. The model shows a good fit for the most frequent area bin (300 vs 300 km) but does not fit well for area bins with a low observation frequency (e.g. 750 vs 750 km). Advanced methods for model fitting are presented in Laaha et al. (2013).

### Kriging
The prediction function `rtopKrige` solves the kriging system based on the computed regularized semivariances. The covariance matrices are internally created by a separate regularization function (`varMat`), and stored in the `rtopObj` for easier access if it is necessary to redo parts of the analysis, as this is the computationally expensive part of the prediction.

```{r}
rtopObj <- rtopKrige(rtopObj)

names(rtopObj$predictions)

spplot(obj=rtopObj$predictions, zcol=c("obs", "var1.pred","var1.var"),
       names.attr=c("obs", "pred", "var"),
       col.regions = rev(heat.colors(n=100)), col="grey",
       main="Prediction: sqrt(q95)")
```

We can see that Top-kriging yields topologically consistent low flow predictions for the entire river network. Note that the maps display transformed low flow values. The predicted patterns of small (sub-)catchment (pred) appear fully consistent with the observation map (obs). The kriging variance map (var) shows that the predictions are most accurate in data-rich areas and least accurate in data-poor areas.

### Cross-validation
Cross-validation can be called from `rtopKrige` if the argument `cv=TRUE` is set. The results allow us to assess how well the model performs in the prediction case.

In our first assessment we produce synoptic maps of observations and cv-predictions (together with the cv-kriging variance). We can see that the cross-validation corresponds well with observations and shows an equal performance over the study area.

```{r}
rtopObj.cv <- rtopKrige(rtopObj, cv = TRUE)

names(rtopObj.cv$predictions)


spplot(obj=rtopObj.cv$predictions, zcol=c("obs", "var1.pred","var1.var"),
       names.attr=c("obs", "pred", "var"),
       col.regions = rev(heat.colors(n=100)), col="grey",
       main="Cross-validation: sqrt(q95)")
```

In our second assessment we produce some residual plots that are useful for investigating the predictive performance of our model in more detail. The first two plots in the upper panel show the distribution of residual (predicted - observed) values as a histogram and in a scatter-plot. We can see that the errors are symmetrically distributed around zero. The scatterplot shows a good agreement of predicted and observed values. Some underestimation of low values and overestimation of high values is visible, which is a typical effect of the simplification associated with modeling.

```{r, fig.height = 8}
cv <- rtopObj.cv$predictions

def.par <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
layout(matrix(c(1,2, 1,2, 1,2, 3,3, 3,3, 4,4, 4,4), 7, 2, byrow = TRUE))

par(pty="s", mar=c(5,4,2,2)+0.1)
hist(cv$var1.pred-cv$obs, xlab="Predicted - observed", main=NULL)

xylim <- c(min(cv$obs, cv$var1.pred), max(cv$obs, cv$var1.pred))
plot(x=cv$obs, y=cv$var1.pred, xlab="Observed", ylab="Predicted", xlim=xylim, ylim=xylim)
abline(a=0, b=1)

par(pty="m")
plot(x=cv$var1.pred, y=cv$var1.pred-cv$obs, xlab="Predicted", ylab="Pred - obs")
abline(h=0, lty="dotted")

plot(x=cv$obs, y=cv$var1.pred-cv$obs, xlab="Observed", ylab="Pred - obs")
abline(h=0, lty="dotted")

par(def.par)
```

The remaining two plots show the prediction errors against predicted values (center panel) and against observed values (lower panel). The latter presents the residuals visible from the scatter plot in an alternative way, reflecting a high performance of the model apart from extreme observations. The scatter plot of residuals against predictions shows that the model exhibits a homogeneous prediction error and predictions are thus equally reliable for the range of predicted values.

We finally calculate cv-performance measures that are commonly used to summarize model performance. The first assessment is based on the transformed values. The model has a low RMSE (compared to the average low flow $sqrt(q_{95})$), practically no bias, and a high coefficient of determination. The second assessment shows that the high performance is maintained after the back-transformation of the predictions to $q_{95}$, a necessary step to obtain final results. From all assessments, the model appears well suited to perform low flow predictions in the study area.

```{r}
cv_summary <- function (pred, obs) {
res <- pred - obs
ss <- sum(res^2)
mse <- ss/length(res)
rmse <- sqrt(mse)
R2 <- 1-(mse/var(obs))
bias <- mean(res)
return(list("RMSE"=rmse, "BIAS"=bias, "R¬≤"=R2))
}
```


CV-performance of (transformed) $sqrt(q_{95})$
```{r}
cv_summary(pred=rtopObj.cv$predictions$var1.pred, obs=rtopObj.cv$predictions$obs)
```

CV-performance of retransformed $q_{95}$
```{r}
cv_summary(pred=rtopObj.cv$predictions$var1.pred^2, obs=rtopObj.cv$predictions$obs^2)
```
