The Drought Management Briefing from the Environment Agency (England) in Fig. 12.4 shows an example of how to identify drought impacts according to the EDII impact definition and assigning an impact category and type from the classification scheme (Section 12.3.2).

The task involves the following steps: 

 
1. Identify an impact classification scheme and search for a drought impact report 

You need: The EDII classification scheme in Table 12.1 and a drought report of your choice â€“ for example, this could be a newspaper article or a government report on drought impacts from the town, region or country where you live. 

2. Mark all indications of impacts 

Read the report text carefully and identify and mark all mentions of impacts. Re-read carefully the definition of impact used in the EDII (Section 12.3.2), or make up your own robust definition.  

3. Create your own database  

Set up your own database framework. For example use the points in Section 12.3.2 as column headers of a table. As a minimum, your database should contain information about: the information source reference, the location of the impact, the timing of the reported impact (rather than the time of the report) and a short description taken from your report. 

4. Insert one or several reported impacts into your new impact database 

For each marked impact, you need to create a record in your own impact database (e.g. a new row for each impact in your table). Fill in all the required information from 3., in particular assign the reported impact to a category and one or more sub-types using the classification system in Table 12.1.
