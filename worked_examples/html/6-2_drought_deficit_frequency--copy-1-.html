<p>The pooled drought events obtained in Worked Example 5.4 (Section 5.4.1) can be concieved as a partial duration series (PDS) because after removing 77 minor droughts only 100 events above and equal to the following thresholds remained in the series.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>threshold </code></pre>

<p>Two drought characteristics are analysed in the following: drought deficit volume and real drought duration as defined in Worked Example 5.4.</p>
<p>Drought events were selected for River Ngaruroro and details of the selection criteria are given in Worked Example 5.4. The series cover the period 1964 to 2018 and the start of the year is set to 1 September.</p>
<p>A total of eight years were omitted from the series, 1963/64, 1965/66, 1977/78, 1978/79, 1986/87, 1987/88, 2001/02 and 2019/20, due to missing data. As a result 49 years remained in the dataset.</p>
<p>As only events below the <span class="math inline">\(Q_{90}\)</span> percentile are selected, it might happen that the flow never becomes less than the threshold in a year (non-drought year).</p>
<p>A total of five out of the 49 years with observations did not experience a drought (34.7%). The PDS series of drought deficit volume and real duration are plotted in Figure 6.12. Less severe values are found in the second half of the observation period for both deficit volume (upper) and duration (lower). The data are still treated as one sample as the number of observations is considered insufficient for a separate analysis of two periods. It should further be noted that a similar trend towards less severe droughts is not as pronounced for the <span class="math inline">\(AM(1)\)</span> values (Worked Example 6.1). This is likely a result of the high base flow contribution in the catchment (Figure 6.6).</p>

<h1 number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Derivation of distribution function</h1>
<p>in the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v072i08/v72i08.pdf">Journal of Statistical Software</a> there is an article describing the extremes package.</p>
<p>Their approach is identical to Equation 6.11 in the first edition of the book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The quantiles of the GP df are easily obtained by setting Equation 5 equal to <span class="math inline">\(1 - p\)</span> and inverting. However, the quantiles of the GP df cannot be as readily interpreted as return levels because the data no longer derive from specific blocks of equal length. Instead, an estimate of the probability of exceeding the threshold, e.g., called <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_u\)</span> , is required. Then, the value <span class="math inline">\(x_m\)</span> that is exceeded on average once every <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> observations (i.e., an estimated return level) is”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x_m = u + \frac{\sigma_u}{\xi} \left[ (m \zeta_u)^\xi - 1\right] \]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> being the return period and <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_u\)</span> the overall exceedance rate (= average number of exceedances per year). So the return period is just multiplied with the exceedance rate. <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is the location parameter of the GPA (= threshold), <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_u\)</span> is scale and <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is shape. In our case <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_u = \frac{\text{length of PDS}}{\text{record length in years}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>This transformation will introduce return periods of less than a year (or negative probabilities) for values <span class="math inline">\(P_{PDS} &lt; 1 + \zeta_u\)</span>. Return periods for PDS of less than a year just imply that such an event occurs on average several times a year.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{annual} = 1 - \frac{(1 - P_{PDS})}{\zeta_u}\]</span></p>
<p>I’ve seen PDS return periods &lt; 1 for example in <a href="https://iwaponline.com/hr/article/8/1/57/1454/Return-Periods-of-Hydrological-EventsPaper">Return Periods of Hydrological Events, Rojsberg 1976</a>. I’ve also looked at his approach of relating PDS and AMS. But for return periods &gt; 10 years quantiles of the AMS and PDS are practically identical, irrespective of the exceedance rate.</p>
<p>Following Zelenhasic &amp; Salvai (1987) an estimate of the non-exceedance probability, <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span>, for the largest event in each time interval is in Nizowka obtained by combining the distribution for the occurrence of events and the distribution for the magnitudes of deficit volume or duration. Here a time interval of one year is chosen. Subsequently the return period in years for a given event can be calculated. The number of drought events occurring in a time period t is commonly assumed to be Poisson distributed (Equation 6.9) with parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda t\)</span>. In Nizowka the binomial Pascal distribution is offered along with the Poisson distribution as described in ‘Background Information NIZOWKA’ (Software, CD). The distribution that best fitted deficit volume was the Pascal distribution for the number of droughts and the GP distribution for the deficits. For duration the Pascal distribution was chosen along with the Log-Normal distribution. The <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span> is for drought deficit volume plotted in Figure 6.13 together with the observed values plotted using a plotting position. The chosen distribution describes the data well, with the exception of some values in the upper range. The maximum value is, however, satisfactorily modelled.</p>
