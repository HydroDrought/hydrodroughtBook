# Data

This section describes several datasets that are used to illustrate methodologies and approaches presented. The International Dataset (Section 4.5.1) is a collation of flow time series from across the world reflecting different climatic and physiographic conditions. Some of these time series are affected by human interventions. The International Dataset is used for several worked examples, mainly in Chapters 5 to 7. The Regional Dataset of Eastern Austria (Section 4.5.2) contains data from 30 catchments that are located in four different geological settings. The dataset is used for worked examples in Chapters 5 and 8. Two local datasets are introduced in Section 4.5.3, i.e. the Upper-Guadiana catchment (Spain) and the Stonor Park well (UK). Time series of groundwater levels are provided in both datasets. In addition, time series of flow data are available at the outlet of the Upper-Guadiana catchment in the International Dataset. Upper-Guadiana data are used in Chapter 10, whereas the groundwater data from the Stonor Park well are used in Chapters 3 and 5.

Need to fix the links.
